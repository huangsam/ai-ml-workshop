# AI/ML workshop

The goal of this Git repository is for me to learn and practice AI/ML concepts and techniques. It contains code examples, tutorials, and projects that I work on to enhance my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I will be covering the usage of PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain and any other relevant libraries and frameworks.

Prior to this, I will also brush up on my knowledge of Python programming, data manipulation with libraries like NumPy and Pandas, and data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Furthermore, I will revisit my Coursera ML course materials to reinforce foundational concepts.
